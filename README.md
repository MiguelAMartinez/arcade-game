# Arcade Game 
In this project, I utilized JavaScript's object-oriented style and pseudoclassical subclasses to 
create a copy of the classic game Frogger. This game was built on Udacity's [template code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game), in which Udacity provided the art assets and game engine. My code is most of the 
code in the `app.js` file, and some of the code in the `engine.js` file. For easy comparison, I have included in the 
`js` folder the original versions of the files, which are named `app-original.js` and `engine-original.js`. My code 
created the player, enemies, and their specific movement patterns, as well as the messages displayed in the game. 

## Game rules
Use the arrow keys to move the player to the water while avoiding the bugs. 

## Play the game
