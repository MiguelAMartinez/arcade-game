# Arcade Game 
In this project, I utilized JavaScript's object-oriented style and pseudoclassical subclasses to 
create a copy of the classic game Frogger. This game was built on Udacity's [template code](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game), in which Udacity provided the art assets and game engine. I wrote most of the 
code in `js/app.js`, and some of the code in `js/engine.js`. For easy comparison, I have included the original versions of these two files, which are named `js/app-original.js` and `js/engine-original.js`. My code 
created the player, enemies, and their specific movement patterns, as well as the messages displayed in the game. 

## Game rules
Use the arrow keys to move the player to the water while avoiding the bugs. 

## Play the game
Open the web game [here](https://miguelamartinez.github.io/arcade-game). 
Alternatively, download the application files and open the `index.html` file.
